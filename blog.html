                        <p>So I've decided to start homelabbing after so many years of putting it off due to a multitude
                            of excuses like finding reliable low powered machines and really, just finding a <i>need</i>
                            for a
                            homelab. Buuut because I have a newfound interest in system administration, the no-brainer
                            thing for me to do is to setup proxmox and start commandeering my own fleet of VMs
                            to help study for certs and use it for testing. So for me personally, I really love mini PCs. They
                            have
                            everything that a typical laptop has to offer but with a tad bit more features, like
                            more room for custom peripherals and more beefier components. These computers are quiet too! Just about any pc should do
                            the trick though! For now, my main
                            setup shall be a simple mini PC! It's a GMKtec NucBox K5.</p>
                        <p>This <b>beast</b> of a machine packs an 8-core AMD Ryzen CPU, 2TB of storage and 32GB of DDR5
                            memory. Plenty for my virtualization and sandboxing needs.</p>

                        <p>After many days of brainstorming and trying to think up of a logical way to start a neat
                            little blog with the countless of methods out there, I've decided to settle using Github
                            Pages. All the code here will be written by hand for now.</p>
